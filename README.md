## Live Web Application

 ## Quote Application
  This is a probject I worked on as a result of my completion of the Backend Software Development course on Course Careers. This project includes a fully working front-end and back-end, including a MongoDB Database. This application allows a user to create an account, loging and get a signed JWT for authentication. With this, they are able to create a new quote and upload it to the database. Aswell, users are capable of editing or deleting their own quotes they uploaded. Along with that is user controls, including the capability to change their username or delete their account. All users also have the ability to see all users registered on the application, and all quotes uploaded. It even includes a query search where you can search for quotes based on a user's Username, User ID, the Author of the quote, or by the tags attached to the quote. I have also included Admin controls, which allow Admins to delete any user or quotes, excluding other Admin users or themselves.
 
  This is one of the biggest projects I have taken on by myself, and it took about 3 weeks of information aggregating to put it all together, along with all the information I learned from the course. While its not a massive app, there is a decent amount of things for Users to do. This application serves as a testamate to my ability to implement frontend and backend integration that works with a NoSQL Database using the MERN Stack.
